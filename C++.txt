Compiler    : Source Files -> Object Files
Linker      : Object File -> Executable

C++ code blocks are created with curly braces { } .
C++ statements end with a semicolon ;

Starting Point Of An Application
    Applications start from the main method.
    The return type of main method is int.
    The return value indicates a success or errors.
    Example
    int main() {
        return 0;
    }

Errors
    There are three types of errors.
    Compile-Time Errors
    Link-Time Errors
    Run-Time Errors

Operators
    <<  Sends something to a stream.
        This operator is chainable.
    >>  Reads something from a stream.
    ::  Scope resolution operator.

Preprocessor Directives
    #include <library name>
    #include "user_header.h"

Namespaces
    using namespace std;    // BAD PRACTICE!
    using std::cout;        // GOOD PRACTICE!

Stream IO
    std::cout
    std::cin

Comments
    // This is a single line comment.
    /* ...*/ This is a multi line comment.

Types
    Variables have types.
    Expressions also have types.
    Built-in types are not automatically initialized.
    An arithmetic operation with a float/double and int will result a float/double.

Conditional Operators
    ==
    !=
    <
    <=
    >
    >=

If Statement
    if (conditional expression) {
        // Statements...
    }
    else {
        // Statements...
    }

While Loop
    while (conditional expression) {
        // Statements...
        // Change conditional variables...
    }

For Loop
    for (int i = 0; i < something; i++) {

    }

Declaring A Function
    int add(int a, int b);

Defining A Function
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

Overloading A Function
    We can have two functions with the same name.
    Their signiture must be different.
    Argument count and / or types must be different.
    Example
    int add(int a, int b);
    double add(double a, double b);
    When the function call gives two acceptable choices, 
    The compiler will throw an error because of the ambiguity.

Header Files
    We put the declarations into header files.
    And we include header files when we need to use functions.
    Header files are not compiled.
